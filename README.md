# Ansible in Docker

This is a simple Docker container that contains [Ansible]. It has been created
so that it's easier to work with `ansible-playbook` without going through the
effort of installing it on various systems.

The image is based on Alpine Linux and includes:

- Ansible 4.2.0

## Support

Tests have been made on Ubuntu 18 and macOS 11 (Apple Silicon). More tests are
underway.
